# EXP.NO.3.-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-DELTA-MODULATION

3.Implementation of Delta Modulation 
  
## AIM    
 To study the Delta modulation using the Delta Modulation trainer kit. 
## APPARATUS REQUIRED
Trainer Kit, DSO(10MHz) , Patch Cords and Power Supply (0-30V)   
## PROCEDURE
```
1. Initial Setup:

Switch off all devices before connections.
Connect the power supply to the trainer kit.
Ensure the kit is set to Delta Modulation mode (not Adaptive Delta or PCM).

2. Input Signal Configuration:

Connect a function generator to the analog input terminal of the kit.
Set the function generator to produce a sine wave (1 kHz typical) with a small amplitude (say 2V peak-to-peak).
Connect the output of the function generator to the analog input port of the kit.

3. Observe Modulated Output:

Power ON the kit.
Connect an oscilloscope probe to the modulated output (DM signal) terminal.
Observe the Delta Modulated waveform on Channel 1 of the CRO.

4. Demodulation:

Connect the demodulator output to Channel 2 of the oscilloscope.
Observe the reconstructed signal and compare it with the input sine wave.

5. Adjust Parameters (Optional):

Some kits allow you to vary the step size (Î”).
Try varying the input frequency or amplitude and observe how the modulator handles slope overload or granular noise.
Note the effect of changes in input frequency and amplitude on the output waveform.

6. Record Observations:
    Draw the waveforms for:
        i)   Input analog signal
        ii)  Integrater output
        iii) sample output
        iv)  Filter output

## RESULT 
   Thus the delta modulation is verified successfully and the output waveform is obtained.
